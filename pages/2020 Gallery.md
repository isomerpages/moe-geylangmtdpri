### National Day Celebration

On 7 August 2020, the school celebrated Singapore's 55th birthday.&nbsp;Our theme for this year is,&nbsp;**"Together, A Stronger Singapore. Together, A Stronger GMSP."**&nbsp;

There is always a joyful reason to sing despite the challenges we face as a nation. We have specially made this video,&nbsp;**"Why We Sing"**, to commemorate National Day.

You can also view it via the school's Facebook page: <br>

Enjoy and stay safe, stay healthy!!!
