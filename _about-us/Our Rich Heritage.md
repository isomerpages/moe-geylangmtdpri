The school was started in 1924 as Geylang Methodist Girls' School (GMGS) in the humble beginnings of a small, sparsely furnished but functional classroom converted from the extra space carved out from the premises of Geylang Chinese Methodist Church. The setting up of a school for girls was an initiative of the Methodist Episcopal Mission in pre-war Singapore, and it sought to provide education for girls in an impoverished Geylang area, and be a beacon of light for the students and community.

The early years were a struggle. There was no land nor funds to build the school. Undeterred, the school’s early founders continued to go house-to-house to canvass for students. From the very beginning, missionaries and pastors of the church provided supervision and strong support to the school.

With financial support of many well-wishers and the Methodist Churches, the school grew from strength to strength. To meet increasing enrolment, GMGS grew and expanded to form Geylang Methodist Primary School and Geylang Methodist Secondary School in 1984 along Geylang East Central, where both schools are now situated. It was also in this year that the schools became co-educational. The schools were later renamed Geylang Methodist Schools (Primary and Secondary) to reflect oneness in the family.

### Many Helping Hands

Of the many helping hands that supported the building of the school, one missionary and one educator played pivotal roles in starting the school – Reverend Floyd Sullivan and Miss Emma Eaton Walker.

With Reverend Sullivan’s strong support and oversight, the setting up of GMGS was facilitated during his tenure as District Superintendant of the Methodist Church in Singapore. Reverend Sullivan also personally read the dedicatory service of the new building of the Geylang Methodist Church and Geylang Methodist Girls’ School in the founding.
