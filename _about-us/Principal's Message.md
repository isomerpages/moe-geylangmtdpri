**Dear Parents / Guardians,**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to&nbsp;our new school website and we hope you have found it useful in learning about our school's varied programmes, history and ethos.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are a government-aided Methodist School, committed to nurturing every child holistically in a safe and inclusive Christian environment where the child's well-being is at the centre of all that we do.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our mission is to inspire young minds, nurturing them to be the person God has planned for, with sound values and character. We are always looking out for opportunities to foster the joy of learning, helping our students to discover their interests, grow their passions and love what they do.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The school was established in 1924 with the vision to equip our students to stand out as beacons of light to their peers, family, community and nation, from one generation to another. Over the course of time, we hold fast to this vision. We remain steadfast in our commitment to&nbsp;<b>grow</b>&nbsp;each new generation of students into active young men and women, imbued with a moral compass to guide their decisions and relationships with others, ready to&nbsp;<b>lead</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>serve</b>&nbsp;with compassion and joy. We believe this will, in turn, provide them with more opportunities to&nbsp;<b>grow</b>&nbsp;their skills, attributes and calling to be of service to the community, where their attention, care and support can make a positive difference in the lives of others.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a school family, we are extremely thankful for the strong support given by our board members, parents, alumni and the community. Such positive partnership based on trust, mutual respect and collaboration is crucial in helping each child learn, grow and excel, both at home and in school.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we hope you have found the information helpful. Should you need more details, please write in to gmsp@moe.edu.sg and we will assist you. We look forward to welcoming your child to our school. GMS(P) is an exciting place to Grow in Friendship, Body and Mind - the school motto that is ever so endearing.  <br>
  
Thank you.  <br><br>

<b>Yours sincerely,</b><br>
<b>Mrs Jennifer Choy</b> <br>
<b>Principal</b></p>
