<p style="text-align: justify;">Geylang Methodist School (Primary) is a Christian mission school with a rich heritage, offering a robust values-based education designed to inspire minds, nurture character and touch the community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The year 2024 holds a special significance for us as we joyously commemorate our centennial anniversary with the theme “Celebrating God’s Goodness”. Drawing inspiration from Psalm 100:5 – “For the Lord is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations”, we reflect on God’s enduring love for each one of us and his unwavering faithfulness to our school over the decades.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this monumental year, we have planned heritage projects and celebrations in collaboration with our Board of Management and key partners. These initiatives aim to provide students with insights into the values exemplified by our founders and pioneering leaders, inspiring a commitment to being a beacon in the community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Rooted in these values, GMS(P) continues to provide a holistic education to nurture the whole child through a curriculum tailored to embrace all learners. Our dedicated team of teaching and non-teaching staff work diligently to enhance the well-being of our students, creating a caring and enabling environment for learning and growth, carrying forward the legacy left by our founders, Reverend Floyd Herman Sullivan and Miss Emma Eaton Walker.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We look forward to sharing the warmth and values of the Geylang Methodist family with you. Whether you are a prospective student, parent or community member, we extend an invitation to explore our school through this website and learn more about the legacy and commitment that define Geylang Methodist School (Primary).</p>
