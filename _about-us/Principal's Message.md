<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to Geylang Methodist School (Primary)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Geylang Methodist School (Primary) is a Christian mission school with a proud heritage and a steadfast commitment to values-based education. Our mission is to inspire young minds, nurture strong character, and impact the community positively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year marked a significant milestone in our history as Geylang Methodist School (Primary &amp; Secondary) celebrated its 100th anniversary. This momentous occasion was commemorated with heritage projects and celebratory events, organized in collaboration with our Board of Management and key partners. These initiatives offered our students valuable insights into the timeless values upheld by our founders and pioneering leaders to be beacons in their communities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Building on this rich legacy, GMS(P) remains dedicated to providing a holistic education that nurtures the whole child. Our curriculum is thoughtfully designed to cater to diverse learners, ensuring that every student is equipped to thrive. Our team of devoted teaching and non-teaching staff work tirelessly to create a supportive and caring environment that fosters well-being, learning, and growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As we embrace the future and embark on the next 100 years, we are guided by the theme “Grow, Lead, and Serve with Joy” and the biblical inspiration from 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18a: <i>“Rejoice always; pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances.”</i> With these guiding principles, we aim to provide a nurturing environment where our students develop a love for learning, adopt a growth mindset, lead with integrity, and serve the community with purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We warmly invite you to explore our website and discover more about the Geylang Methodist family—a community built on faith, values, and excellence. Whether you are a prospective student, parent, or community member, we look forward to sharing our legacy, our vision, and the unique warmth of our school with you.</p>
