<p style="text-align: justify;">Geylang Methodist School (Primary) is a 102-year-old Christian mission school with a proud heritage and a steadfast commitment to values-based education. Guided by our mission to inspire young minds, nurture strong character, and make a positive impact on the community, we continue to uphold a legacy of faith, service, and excellence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Building on this rich heritage, GMS(P) is dedicated to providing a holistic education that nurtures the whole child. Our student-centric, values-based, and future-oriented curriculum is thoughtfully designed to meet the diverse needs of our learners. By leveraging educational technology and innovative e-pedagogies, we equip our students with a strong foundation and essential 21st-century competencies, empowering them to thrive in an increasingly globalised world. Supported by a committed team of teaching and non-teaching staff, our school provides a caring and supportive environment that promotes well-being, joyful learning, and continuous growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While preparing our students for the future is essential, education at GMS(P) is deeply rooted in love and faith. Our school theme for the year, _“The Way of Love,”_ inspired by 1 Corinthians 13:13 — _“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love”_ — reflects our commitment to nurturing a loving environment. Through this, our students experience God’s love and learn to love themselves, embrace learning, respect and serve others, and persevere through life’s challenges with resilience and hope.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We warmly invite you to explore our website and discover more about the Geylang Methodist family — a community built on faith, values, and excellence. Whether you are a prospective student, parent, or community member, we look forward to sharing our heritage, our vision, and the distinctive warmth that defines our school.</p>
