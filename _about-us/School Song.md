### Background of the School Song

The school song was written by Miss Mariam Jean Gruber, a renowned music composer from the World Division of the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church in 1975. Miss Susheela Daniel, daughter of GMGS's longest-serving principal, Mrs S A Daniel, composed the music score for the school song.

The school song, which has been adapted over time, continues to inspire all and reminds us to remain faithful to the Truths of God.

<strong><i>In Geylang Methodist we strive </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>To grow in friendship, body and mind</i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>And never fail to keep alive</i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>The Truths of God which guide mankind. </i></strong> 

<strong><i>With grateful hearts we sing the praise </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>Of Geylang Methodist today </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>And to her glory now we raise </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>Our pledge of loyalty for aye. </i></strong> 

<strong><i>When from each other we must part </i></strong> <br> 
<strong><i>And cares of life around us press </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>One thing will live within each heart </i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>The memory of G. M. S. </i></strong>
