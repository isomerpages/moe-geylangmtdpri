<center> We, the students of Geylang Methodist, pledge to be <br>
United as one big family <br>
To grow in Friendship, Body and Mind <br> 
To be gracious, caring and kind <br> 
Enter to learn, depart to serve <br> 
Our heritage we will preserve <br> 
With the Lord our Guide <br>
Always by our side </center>
