<p>The Board of Management (BOM) is appointed on a 3-year term by the Bishop
of the Methodist Church. The BOM meets with Church leaders to discuss how
they can contribute towards providing&nbsp;GMS&nbsp;students with a wholesome
education, with emphasis on the core values of the school.</p>
<p>The BOM works collaboratively with other partners of the school to enrich
the school programmes. It also provides the link to garner the support
of the Education Council of the Methodist Church of Singapore, e.g. the
Vice-Chairman of the BOM oversees the fund raising efforts for PRIME.</p>
<p>The BOM acknowledges the work of the staff and has implemented the five-year
Long Service Award since 2005. It also initiated the re-naming of the school
to better reflect the oneness of the GM family of schools. The BOM led
in the re-designing of the school crest launched in Aug 2007.</p>
