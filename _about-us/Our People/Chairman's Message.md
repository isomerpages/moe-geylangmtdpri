<p>In recent years, we have witnessed profound and often unsettling changes
in the world.&nbsp;Trade wars, misinformation, political turmoil, social
media and rapid technological advances challenge our sense of stability
and shape how we think, live, and relate to one another. In such times,
we may begin to ask: What is truly lasting?&nbsp;What is the purpose of
life? What is the meaning behind what we do?</p>
<p>As Christians, we believe that while the world changes, God does not.
The Bible reminds us:</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:8
<br>“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”</p>
<p>God’s Word provides a firm foundation — a steady anchor for our lives.
It teaches us who we are, how we are to live, and how we are to care for
one another and for creation.</p>
<p>Christian schools stand on a rich heritage of faith-based education. Grounded
in God’s Word, character formation is a defining hallmark of Christian
education. Beyond academic excellence, we seek to nurture in our students
a strong and ethical value system — an enduring anchor that empowers them
to become the best versions of themselves in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>While academic training equips students for the workplace, technological
advancement has shortened the “shelf life” of knowledge and skills. To
remain relevant, we must continually learn and adapt. Yet a value system
rooted in God’s Word endures for life. It shapes character, guides decisions,
and provides clarity amid uncertainty. As Scripture declares:</p>
<p>Psalm 119:105
<br>“Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.”</p>
<p>I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to our principals, teachers,
and staff for their selfless dedication to our students and for their unwavering
commitment to GMS. During these formative years, our educators impart not
only knowledge and skills, but also values, convictions, and habits that
shape character and life direction.</p>
<p>Such holistic nurturing is made possible through the steadfast partnership
of our Parent Support Group, Geylang Chinese Methodist Church, and Christalite
Methodist Chapel. We are deeply grateful for your support and shared vision.</p>
<p>To God be the Glory.
<br>
<br>
