<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent times, we have experienced tumultuous changes in the world. Trade wars, fake news, political turmoil – all shake our views of what we stand for, and who or what we trust. New technologies increasingly shape our lives. Social media connect like-minded individuals throughout the world, magnifying their voices and views.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If everything changes, and we have nothing to ‘anchor’ our lives, our value system will be compromised. We will become uncertain as to what is right and worthy to be cherished. We may even cynically say, “Why bother?” Increasingly we may ask: What is the purpose of life? What is the meaning of what we do?  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We need a basis for how we think about ourselves, our families, our friends, and about life. Fortunately, some things do not change. The Bible says:  
  

</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> _Hebrews 8:13_&nbsp;Jesus Christ is the same<b> yesterday and today and forever.</b>
   
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> _Psalms 119:152-160&nbsp;<b>Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever. … All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.</b>_&nbsp;
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Who God is, what He did, what He instructed us about us, about our responsibilities for each other, for animals and nature, are recorded in the Bible. We can count on Jesus and God’s Word in the Bible as a steady ‘anchor’ of our lives.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Christian schools have a rich tradition in education.&nbsp;<b>With God’s Word as a basis, character formation is a differentiating feature of Christian schools</b>, to give our students a robust, ethical value system, the all important ‘anchor’ to be the best person our graduates can be in this changing world.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Academic training prepares us for the workplace. Rapid technological improvements have reduced the ‘shelf life’ of academic knowledge and skills. We need to continually learn and acquire new skills to be relevant to the job market. A value system based on God’s word, that undergirds our character, is for life. It is like a lamp that shines the way forward as we journey through life’s confusing pathways.  
  

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">_Psalms 119:105&nbsp;<b>Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.</b>_

  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to thank all our principals, teachers and staff for their selfless devotion to our students, for their heart and hard work in GMS. Our teachers play a critical role in our students’ formative years, imparting not only knowledge and skills, but also values, beliefs, and habits to nurture our students in character formation. Such a holistic nurturing and learning environment is also possible because of our partners, especially our Parent Support Group, Geylang Chinese Methodist Church and Christalite Methodist Chapel.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To God be the Glory.  <br><br>
