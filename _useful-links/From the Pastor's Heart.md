**A word of encouragement from morning devotion**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Daily morning devotions are such an important part of our heritage as a school and it is with great joy that we share an encouraging word by the Pastor-in-Charge of Christalite Methodist Chapel, Reverend Shaun Chong.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GMS(P) wishes everyone peace, health and safety as we transit into work and play under the new normal!&nbsp;<br>
