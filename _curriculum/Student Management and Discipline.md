<h4><strong><u>Vision</u></strong></h4>
<p>Every GMS(P) student a socially and emotionally competent individual who
is confident to face his/her future challenges.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Mission</u></strong></h4>
<p>To provide the competencies and support needed by our students to meet
their current developmental needs and beyond.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Discipline in GMS(P)&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In GMS(P), we cultivate a positive and proactive approach to school discipline.
We implement a whole-school approach to uphold student discipline, guided
by the following principles:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stude​nts learn well
when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they need care, encouragement,
and space to learn from mistakes and improve.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discipline is an educative
process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in
students.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disciplinary measures
serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment,
and must be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.</p>

<p><strong><u>Student Leadership in GMS(P)&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In GMS(P), we believe in providing students with tiered leadership opportunities
to support their growth and development.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students cultivate key values, develop their
social and emotional learning, and develop essential employability skills,
qualities, and attitudes such as problem-solving, resilience, and open-mindedness.</p>
<p>GMS(P) adopts Servant Leadership as our student leadership philosophy.
We strive to nurture students with the passion and compassion to serve
others before themselves. In doing so, they will enrich the lives of others,
strengthen organizations, and contribute to a more just and caring world.</p>
