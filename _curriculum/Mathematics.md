<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every GMS(P) Student An Analytical Lifelong Problem-Solver</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To equip students with the concepts, skills and disposition so that they
can learn and apply Mathematics joyfully with their peers</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p></p>
<p>In GMS(P), we strongly believe that all students can learn mathematics,
given the appropriate instruction and opportunity to learn. The belief
that they can learn mathematics drives student effort. Our dedicated teachers
help their students by ensuring that they experience success in learning
mathematics. When students see that they can learn mathematics by putting
in effort, they will develop a growth mind-set.</p>
<p>The mathematics curriculum aims to nurture students to be confident and
effective problem-solvers. We advocate incorporating a variety of approaches
and activities to make learning of mathematics both engaging and fun for
our young ones. And we also need to garner parents’ support to reinforce
basic numeracy concepts at home.</p>

<h4>Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies</h4>
<p></p>
<p>At primary level, we teach students to learn and master mathematical concepts
using a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial and abstract.
In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences
using concrete objects such as multilink cubes, paper folding. This is
followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts.
Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers
and symbols.</p>
<p>In our department, we practice the four-step problem solving method namely
1) See, 2) Plan, 3) Do and 4) Check, that students can use to tackle the
word problems. For Step 2 under planning, we guide and expose the 9 listed <u>heuristics</u> to
our students.
<br>
</p>
<p><u>Heuristics</u>
<br>1.&nbsp;Find a pattern
<br>2. Draw a model
<br>3. Work backwards
<br>4. Make a table / listing
<br>5. Draw a picture / diagram
<br>6. Make a list / Guess and check
<br>7. Spatial visualization
<br>8. Use logical reasoning
<br>9. Restating the problem</p>
<p></p>
<p>From time to time, appropriate enrichment programmes are conducted and
selected students do participate in external events or competitions.</p>
