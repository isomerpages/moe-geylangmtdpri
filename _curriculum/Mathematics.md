<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every GMS(P) Student An Analytical Lifelong Problem-Solver</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To equip students with the concepts, skills and disposition so that they
can learn and apply Mathematics joyfully with their peers</p>
<h4>Mathematics at GMS(P)</h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe all students can learn
mathematics with&nbsp; the right instruction and opportunities.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong belief in their ability
drives effort, fostering a growth mindset.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dedicated teachers ensure students
experience success in learning mathematics.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curriculum nurtures confident
and effective problem-solvers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use diverse and engaging approaches
to make learning alive, meaningful and joyful.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parental support is key in reinforcing
numeracy skills at home.</p>
<h4>Key Mathematics Programmes and Achievements at GMS(P)</h4>
<p>At GMS(P), we strive to cultivate a deep understanding and appreciation
for mathematics through engaging and innovative programmes. Below are some
of our key initiatives and notable achievements.</p>

<h4>Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies</h4>
<p></p>
<p>At primary level, we teach students to learn and master mathematical concepts
using a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial and abstract.
In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences
using concrete objects such as multilink cubes, paper folding. This is
followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts.
Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers
and symbols.</p>
<p>In our department, we practice the four-step problem solving method namely
1) See, 2) Plan, 3) Do and 4) Check, that students can use to tackle the
word problems. For Step 2 under planning, we guide and expose the 9 listed <u>heuristics</u> to
our students.
<br>
</p>
<p><u>Heuristics</u>
<br>1.&nbsp;Find a pattern
<br>2. Draw a model
<br>3. Work backwards
<br>4. Make a table / listing
<br>5. Draw a picture / diagram
<br>6. Make a list / Guess and check
<br>7. Spatial visualization
<br>8. Use logical reasoning
<br>9. Restating the problem</p>
<p></p>
<p>From time to time, appropriate enrichment programmes are conducted and
selected students do participate in external events or competitions.</p>
