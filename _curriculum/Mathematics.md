### Vision

Every GMS(P) Student An Analytical Lifelong Problem-Solver

### Mission

To equip students with the concepts, skills and disposition so that they can learn and apply Mathematics joyfully with their peers

### Overview

In GMS(P), we strongly believe that all students can learn mathematics, given the appropriate instruction and opportunity to learn. The belief that they can learn mathematics drives student effort. Our dedicated teachers help their students by ensuring that they experience success in learning mathematics. When students see that they can learn mathematics by putting in effort, they will develop a growth mind-set.

The Mathematics curriculum aims to nurture students to be confident and effective problem-solvers. We advocate incorporating a variety of approaches and activities to make learning of mathematics both engaging and fun for our young ones. And we also need to garner parentsâ€™ support to reinforce basic numeracy concepts at home.

### Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies

At the primary level, we teach students to learn and master mathematical concepts using a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial and abstract. In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences using concrete objects such as multilink cubes and paper folding. This is followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts. Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers and symbols.

In our department, we practice the four-step problem solving method, namely 1) See 2) Plan 3) Do and 4) Check, that students can use to tackle the word problems. For Step 2 under planning, we guide and expose the 9 listed strategies to our students.  
  
<u>Strategies:</u><br>
1\. Find a pattern  
2\. Draw a model  
3\. Work backwards  
4\. Make a table / listing  
5\. Draw a picture / diagram  
6\. Make a list / Guess and check  
7\. Spatial visualisation  
8\. Use logical reasoning  
9\. Restating the problem
