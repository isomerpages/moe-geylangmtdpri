The students will undergo the 5E framework in all the topics and the learning will be more student-centric in which students are expected to plan and conduct their own experiments by the time they reach Primary 6.  
  
Due to the affordance of ICT and our school facilities, the department also taps on Place-Based learning to allow learning to take place outside the classroom through our Sensory Gardens and Eco-Gardens. This helps us to engage students, arouse their curiosity and develop their process skills such as observation skills and questioning.
