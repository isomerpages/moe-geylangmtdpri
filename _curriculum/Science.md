<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Inspired by values, enculturated in the practices of science</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To inspire Scientific learning based on ethical reasoning and impact the
society positively
<br>
</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The science curriculum in GMS(P) is guided by the MOE Science curriculum
framework (2023).
<br>
</p>

<p>Central to the goal of science education is to provide students with a
strong foundation in Science for life and society.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Inspire, Inquire and Innovate in GMS(P) Science<br></h4>
<p>In line with the MOE curriculum framework, the teaching and learning of
science in GMS(P) endeavors to provide students with the experiences of
being Inspired by Science, Inquire like Scientist and Innovate using Science.
Thus, we seek to:</p>
<p>
<br>(i) <strong>I</strong>nspire and develop Interest in Science in our students
<br>
</p>
<p>(ii) develop scientific competencies through <strong>I</strong>nquiry-based
learning
<br>
</p>
<p>(iii) provide opportunities for our students to <strong>I</strong>nnovate
using science
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides helping students to develop core ideas in science, our curriculum
also focuses on developing in our students the practices of science; values,
ethics and attitudes. Practices of science serve to highlight that the
discipline of Science is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge
(e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is also a way
of thinking and doing.
<br>
</p>
<p>They represent the set of established procedures and processes associated
with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated
and established, and how science is applied in society respectively.
<br>
</p>
<p>The Practices of Science comprises three intricately linked components:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing (WOTD)
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS)
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relating Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE)
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies</h4>
<p>The 3C Pedagogical framework is adopted to guide teachers in designing
and enacting meaningful inquiry lessons in the classroom.

<p>Harnessing the affordance of ICT and our school facilities, the department
also incorporate learning outside the classroom through our Sensory Gardens
and Eco-Gardens. This helps us to engage students, arouse their curiosity
and develop their process skills such as observation skills and questioning.</p>

<h4>Other Events / Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;Enrichment Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme is for&nbsp;selected P4 &amp; P5 students who demonstrates
keen interest and ability in Science. The programme engages pupils in scientific
investigations involving advanced science concepts. It aims to engage pupils
in scientific inquiry that will help them to develop the habits, attitudes
and dispositions scientists possess as well as gain important 21st century
competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication
skills.&nbsp;<em>(Adapted from MOE website)<br><br></em><strong>2)&nbsp;Participation in External Events or Competitions</strong>
