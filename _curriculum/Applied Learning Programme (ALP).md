<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) places <strong><em>communication at the heart of real-world learning</em></strong>.
Anchored in our commitment to developing informed, confident and empathetic
communicators, ALP provides a progressive platform for students to apply
English language meaningfully beyond the classroom.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Through ALP, we aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Strengthen students’ ability to make real-world connections by applying
language and literacy skills across authentic contexts and learning experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop critical and discerning thinkers who evaluate information, consider
multiple perspectives and make reasoned judgements in an increasingly complex
information landscape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build confident and empathetic communicators through purposeful oracy,
enabling students to express ideas clearly, listen actively and engage
respectfully with others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>A Progressive Learning Journey</strong></h4>
<p>Across the levels, students experience a thoughtfully designed progression:

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Primary</strong>: Students build confidence and joy in speaking
through speech, drama and poetry, laying strong foundations in expression
and audience awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle Primary</strong>: Students strengthen visual storytelling
and presentation skills, making meaningful connections between ideas and
authentic audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper Primary</strong>: Students research issues, evaluate perspectives
and advocate for meaningful causes, such as environmental sustainability,
applying informed judgement and purposeful communication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach: Experience – Reflect – Pen – Speak</strong></h4>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme adopts a purposeful learning cycle — <strong>Experience, Reflect, Pen, Speak</strong>.</p>
<p>Students engage in <u>meaningful experiences</u> connected to <em>My School, My Community and My World</em>.
They <u>reflect </u>on their learning and its impact on themselves and others,
express their perspectives through <u>writing</u>, and <u>speak </u>with
confidence and empathy.</p>
