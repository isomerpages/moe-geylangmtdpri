<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>To develop citizens of good character, ready to lead and serve.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To inculcate values and equip students with social emotional competencies
and skills to be good individuals and useful citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>In GMS(P), we place great importance on teaching students to be good people
and responsible citizens. This is done through Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE). CCE helps students develop important life skills, such
as understanding their emotions, working well with others, and knowing
right from wrong. It also teaches them how to be active members of society
and find meaning in what they do. All these skills work together to help
students grow into well-rounded individuals who can lead successful and
meaningful lives.</p>
<p>GMSP students (affectionately known as GEMs) are inspired by values to
grow, lead and serve with joy. Values are the building blocks that help
our GEMs grow into caring and responsible people who seek to bear fruit
in every good work. Our daily morning devotion and weekly chapel sessions
inculcate in our GEMs values anchored on bible verses.</p>

<p><strong>Other Events / Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>In GMS(P), students are recognised for their efforts in demonstrating
the values taught through nominations by teachers and peers in platforms
such as the Values Extraordinaire Award, ECHA Award, MWee Award and LKY
Award. Over the years, these Awards have helped to spur our students to
internalize the values taught and to demonstrate them through their daily
lives and actions.</p>

<h3>Student Well Being</h3>
<p>At Geylang Methodist Primary School, every student is a GeM. We are committed
to nurturing their well-being in a safe and supportive environment where
they can grow in friendship, body and mind.</p>
<p>Our dedicated teachers genuinely care for each child, while our pastoral
staff provide regular check-ins and follow-ups to offer guidance and support.
Through engaging assembly programmes, recess activities and chapel sessions,
we instill values and build a caring, inclusive community where every student
feels a sense of belonging.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>&nbsp;</em>Peer Support</h3>
<p>Peer support plays a vital role in fostering a caring and enabling school
environment. We believe that students thrive when they feel supported by
their peers, and our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) play a key role in building
this strong sense of community.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Peer Support Leaders" src="/images/CCE_Picture70.jpg">
</div>
<p>Our PSLs are carefully selected and given the opportunity to lead their
peers in meaningful ways. They undergo specialized training to enhance
their conflict resolution skills and develop the ability to support their
classmates effectively.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE_PSL_001.png">
</div>
<p>Equipped with these skills, they lead to create a positive and encouraging
environment where students feel heard, valued, and supported.</p>
<p>To further build a culture of care, every class has a "You've Got Mail"
mailbox, where students can write notes of encouragement to one another.
This initiative helps to create a caring environment where students learn
to uplift and support each other through edifying words while strengthening
friendships. PSLs are the main drivers of this programme, ensuring that
their peers feel appreciated and connected.</p>

<p>Additionally, PSLs are given opportunities to connect with students across
their level, allowing them to build relationships beyond their immediate
classmates. These interactions not only reinforce the school’s peer support
efforts but also help PSLs develop valuable leadership skills, preparing
them to be confident and compassionate leaders in the future.</p>

<p>At GMS(P), we believe that peer support is more than just a program—it
is a culture of care that strengthens our school community. Through the
dedication of our Peer Support Leaders and the collective effort of students
and staff, we continue to nurture a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment
for all.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Mental well being</h3>
<p>We are committed to nurturing our students' mental well-being alongside
their academic growth. Through various initiatives, we equip students with
essential skills to manage their time and stress effectively.</p>
<p>Year Head Talks and assembly programmes are carried out on a regular basis
to provide valuable guidance on self-management, resilience, and emotional
well-being. In addition, teachers conduct frequent one-on-one check-ins
with students to provide support, offer advice, and address concerns. Regular
termly check-in surveys help teachers monitor students' mental wellness,
allowing for timely follow-ups and interventions when needed.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cyber Wellness</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness is about our students being able to navigate the cyber
space safely.</p>
<p>This is done through our curriculum which aims to equip students with
the knowledge and skills to harness the power of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in
cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.<strong><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></strong>

</p>
<p>At GMS(P), our Cyber Wellness (CW) programme aims to nurture responsible
digital learners who navigate the online world safely and respectfully.
Guided by three key principles—Respect for Self and Others, Safe and Responsible
Use, and Positive Peer Influence—students learn the importance of making
informed and ethical choices online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness education is integrated into FTGP and CCE lessons, with
additional reinforcement through Assembly Talks, the School Messaging Board,
and termly Cyber Wellness Programmes.</p>

</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, parents play a vital role in guiding their children's
screen use and online habits. We believe that fostering Cyber Wellness
is a shared responsibility and encourage parents to work closely with the
school in promoting safe, responsible, and balanced digital use.</p>
<p>To reinforce Cyber Wellness messages at home, parents are encouraged to
engage in "Family Time" activities found in the CCE (FTGP) Journal with
their children. These activities provide meaningful opportunities to discuss
online safety, responsible digital behavior, and the importance of healthy
screen time management. By partnering together, we can help students develop
mindful online behaviors and healthy screen habits both in school and at
home.</p>
