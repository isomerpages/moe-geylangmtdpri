<h4 style="color:blue;">Overview</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Education and Social Studies (NESS) curriculum in Geylang Methodist School (Primary) aims to develop pupils to function effectively as global citizens who stay rooted to Singapore through:

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1) Encouraging perspective-taking in NE discussions especially in contemporary issues to enable our students to have an appreciation of the evolving Singapore Story.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2) Creating experiences that empower students to find their own meaning of what it means to be a Singapore citizen and contribute to the society.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3) Inculcating cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity to interact with people of other  cultures.</p>
