### Overview

The National Education and Social Studies (NESS) curriculum in Geylang Methodist School (Primary) aims to develop pupils to function effectively as global citizens who stay rooted to Singapore through:

1) Encouraging perspective-taking in NE discussions especially in contemporary issues to enable our students to have an appreciation of the evolving Singapore Story.

2) Creating experiences that empower students to find their own meaning of what it means to be a Singapore citizen and contribute to the society.

3) Inculcating cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity to interact with people of other  cultures.
