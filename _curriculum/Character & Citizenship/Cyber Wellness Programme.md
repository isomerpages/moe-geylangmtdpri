Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.

In GMS(P), the Cyber Wellness programme is designed to develop our students into responsible digital learner, based on these guiding principles:  

(1) Respect for Self and Others <br>
(2) Safe and Responsible Use <br>
(3) Positive Peer Influence
  
Besides learning about Cyber Wellness through our structured FTGP and CCE lessons at the various levels, positive online behaviour and safe surfing habits are also inculcated through platforms such as Assembly Talks, School Messaging Board and Cyber Wellness Week.
