<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To IGNITE passion, INSTILL discipline and INSPIRE creativity in our students'
pursuit for artistic excellence.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To create opportunities to students to champion the CREATIVITY and APPRECIATION
of the ARTS.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The Aesthetics Department believes that the arts serve as a powerful platform
to inspire and motivate young minds, encouraging them to become responsible
citizens and fostering a deep connection to their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>As part of ARTSperience@GMS(P), we actively collaborate with a variety
of organizations and communities. (For example, Singapore Art Museum and
National Gallery) These partnerships offer valuable learning opportunities
for our young artists, allowing them to showcase their skills in art and
music across different platforms. Through these collaborations, they form
a supportive learning community that encourages collective and cooperative
growth. Both the ARTSperience and Music programmes foster the development
of meaningful relationships between GMS(P) and our stakeholders.</p>
