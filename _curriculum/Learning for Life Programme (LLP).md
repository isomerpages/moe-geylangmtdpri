<p><strong>Sustainability Education at GMS(P)</strong>
</p>
<p>At <strong>Geylang Methodist School (Primary)</strong>, we are dedicated
to promoting sustainability through our <strong>Sustainability Education</strong> programme,
which is an integral part of the <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong> and
aligns with Singapore's <strong>SG Green Plan 2030</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus Areas</strong>
</p>
<p>Our <strong>Sustainability Education</strong> programme encourages students
to take proactive steps in protecting the environment through the practice
of the <strong>4Rs</strong>:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Refuse</strong> unnecessary
usage to reduce waste</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Reduce</strong> the
materials we use and the waste we create</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Reuse</strong> materials
whenever possible</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Recycle</strong> materials
to conserve resources</p>
<p><strong>Holistic Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>We take a <strong>holistic approach</strong> to sustainability education,
inspired by <strong>Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory</strong>,
which highlights the interconnectedness of students’ development within
their home, school, and community. This framework encourages students to
recognise their role in fostering a sustainable world.</p>

<p><strong>Awareness – Action – Advocacy</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in <strong>service-learning</strong>, where students gain knowledge
by engaging in real-world experiences and take on roles as advocates for
change.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Awareness</strong>:
School-wide initiatives, such as talks and learning journeys, raise awareness
about resource conservation.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Action</strong>: Students
practise civic responsibility through lessons and activities related to
sustainability.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Advocacy</strong>:
Students take on leadership roles, promoting environmental causes and driving
change within the school and the wider community.</p>
<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA) in Sustainable Education</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong> framework
incorporates <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> as a key component of
our sustainability education. VIA empowers students to apply what they
have learned in real-world contexts, fostering a strong sense of responsibility
and community involvement.</p>
<p><strong>VIA and the LLP Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>Our sustainability approach is aligned with the <strong>VIA 6-year developmental plan (2025)</strong>,
which encourages students to progressively take on greater responsibilities
in community service, environmental stewardship, and leadership. Through
VIA, students are empowered to take action that directly benefits the environment
and society, reinforcing the values and skills they acquire through sustainability
education.</p>
<p>This integration ensures that students not only gain knowledge about sustainability
but also actively contribute to making a positive impact in their communities.</p>
