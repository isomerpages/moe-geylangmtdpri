### Key Programmes

* Extensive Reading Programme - Bacalah Sayang 
* <p style="text-align: justify;"> MTL Fortnight Activity<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Pupils learn Malay Language in a fun and creative environment. We make learning Malay Language experience exciting.  Malay Language Fortnight or also known as Dwiminggu Bahasa in GMS(P) is a platform for pupils to actively learn Malay Language and the associated culture so as to experience Malay Language as a ‘living language’. Malay Language Fortnight started on 28 February 2022.  A variety of enriching activities lined up for our pupils during these two weeks. It’s a fun way to learn confidence and communication skills. GMS(P) pupils are nurtured in the right learning environment where we impart essential life skills so that they will develop into a well-balanced and happy young generation who values Malay Language and culture. Among the activities which were carried out were Storytelling, the Making of Bunga Rampai, Pantun Recitation, Dikir Barat and The Art of Epok-epok Making. Students as self-directed learners take responsibility for their own learning. They questioned, reflected and persevered in the pursuit of learning during the entire process of acquiring knowledge and learning to appreciate the heritage and culture associated with Malay Language. <br><br>

* Celebration of Festivals <br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> For the last 2 years since the pandemic, Hari Raya celebration has been celebrated in a different way in most schools. In GMS(P), we managed to bring on the Hari Raya mood by celebrating it via Zoom. There were quizzes for students to participate in, dance performances by Modern Dance and  a song performance by our talented male teachers for everyone to enjoy.</p>

* MTSP - ABLE <br>
<p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Mother Tongue is a challenging subject for many students, especially those from mainly English-speaking families. Therefore, in order to help our students overcome this challenge, the Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) was introduced.  Just like LSP, students who need extra help with their Mother Tongues will learn in small groups of five to eight. Classes involve hands-on activities demonstrating “the practical usefulness of the languages”.  Students learn more actively through interactive learning materials such as picture cards. The small class size will allow students to use their Mother Tongue language more confidently.<br>

* P4 Cultural Camp <br>
* P3 CPAS  <br>
* MTL Buddy Reading <br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The MTL Buddy Reading is a collaboration between the Mother Tongue Department and English Department. According to Vygostky, a psychologist best known for his sociocultural theory,  he believed that  social interaction plays a critical role in children's learning. Hence, this programme aims to firstly promote a peer helping culture, while supporting the weaker students in their reading and provide the platform for student leadership. This programme will begin soon. <br><br>
* Cluster/ National Competitions <br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Mohamed Rehaan Bin Mohamed Fazlin’s essay was awarded as among the 35 best essays in National Level (Primary School) during the 2021 essay writing competition. Mohamed Rehaan’s masterpiece was published in Karya Minda Kreatif 2021. This platform provides opportunities for students to showcase their talents, to instil confidence in writing composition, to sharpen students writing skills &amp; techniques and to encourage the creative and fun learning of the Malay Language. <br>
