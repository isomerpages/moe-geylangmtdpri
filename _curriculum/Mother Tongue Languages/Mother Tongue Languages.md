<h3><strong>Emphasis of The Department</strong></h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>building a strong foundation</strong> for our students
in their Mother Tongue Languages. Through <strong>engaging lessons, interactive activities, and a supportive learning environment</strong>,
we aim to make learning fun and meaningful. Our goal is to instill a love
for the language and equip students with the confidence to use it in daily
life.</p>
<p>To enrich their learning, we organise a variety of <strong>language and cultural activities</strong> throughout
the year. These hands-on experiences help students explore their heritage,
develop communication skills, and strengthen their connection to their
Mother Tongue.</p>
<p>Together, we create a <strong>vibrant and inspiring space</strong> where
students can embrace their Mother Tongue with <strong>confidence and pride</strong>.</p>
