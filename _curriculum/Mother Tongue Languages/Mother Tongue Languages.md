<h3><strong>Emphasis of The Department:</strong></h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>building a strong foundation</strong> for our students
in their Mother Tongue Languages. Through <strong>engaging lessons, interactive activities, and a supportive learning environment</strong>,
we aim to make learning fun and meaningful. Our goal is to instill a love
for the language and equip students with the confidence to use it in daily

the year. These hands-on experiences help students explore their heritage,
