<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning in the Mother tongue is also crucial for improving other critical thinking skills, second language learning, and literacy skills. The Tamil language department in collaboration with the other MT departments @ GMS(P) instills the passion and use of the language to our students through various school-based programmes, activities and beyond. We believe our students will continue to love Tamil Language and render it as a “living language” in years to come.<br></p>

<p></p>

### Level Targeted programmes

1 \.&nbsp;<b>Buddy Reading Programme for Lower Primary</b>: A programme to support selected students in lower primary in reading during pre-assembly periods. Buddies are guided by teachers and are provided with reading materials.<br>

2 \.&nbsp;<b>Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) for Middle Primary</b>: A targeted programme from MOE to uplift selected students who require more reinforcement of their foundation years. Our Tamil teachers are trained to conduct this programme and it is conducted weekly after curriculum time.<br>
    
3 \.&nbsp;<b>DEAR (Drop Everything And Read Programme)</b>: A programme aimed to enthuse and support targeted students in Primary 3 in their Oracy skills using Shared Book Approach. Students enjoyed the weekly sessions and developed their interest in reading and vocabulary building.<br>
    
4 \.&nbsp;<b>Higher Mother Tongue Programme for Middle Primary</b>: GMS(P) was one of the participating schools for the trial of this programme. The aim of this programme is to further stretch students with good language proficiency. Three of our current P6 Higher Mother Tongue students have been involved in the trial programme since 2020. Their keen interest for Tamil language is evident during their participation in class and written work.

### Programmes for all levels:

5 \.&nbsp;<b>TRP (Tamil Reading Programme)</b>: D.E.A.R. has evolved to the current programme as recorded stories for all students on a fortnightly basis. The themes for these stories are based on moral values and culture where students are engaged dialogically in discussions.<br>
    
6 \.&nbsp;<b>MTL Reading Ambassadors</b>: The Reading Ambassadors are reading enthusiasts who support their Tamil teachers during TRP sessions, manage the reading corners at Tamil class, promote suitable book titles and library visits.&nbsp;<br>
    

7 \.&nbsp;<b>Pongal Festival (Term 1)</b>:&nbsp; As an Asian country, the Tamil department teachers believe that our students should have awareness of the significance as rice is our staple food. We plan some interesting activities for our LP, MP and UP students. Videos from Indian Heritage centre are shown during lesson time and students had fun learning new things. At the end of the lesson,

8 \.&nbsp;<b>Mother Tongue Fortnight Activities (Term 2)</b>: The 2-week programme is purposefully planned and conducted by our Tamil Department. Adopting the WOW (Week of Wonder) process from NEL framework, we have developed the thematic approach for our students to gain cultural and historical knowledge of the topics. The activities planned also encourages our students to converse in their Mother Tongue language frequently and more confidently with their peers as they engaged in collaborative, meaningful group work. *Look out for our GMS(P) booth at the upcoming MTL Symposium 2023 for more information on our MTL fortnight.*<br>

In 2021, the team decided to bring the whole school virtually to one of the teacher’s home to learn more about the culture and ways of mannerisms when visiting the Hindu home for celebrations. The medicinal benefits of eating in a banana leaf was explained to the visitor, the types of food placed on the banana leaf and even the way to folding the used banana leaf. The significance of drawing kolam and hanging of mango leaves was something new and interesting for the visitor.<br>

10 \.&nbsp;<b>National/Cultural Events, Workshops &amp; Competitions</b>
Over the years, our enthusiastic students have been participating in national and cluster events. They have made our school proud with their participations and we would also like to take this opportunity to thank their parents for their utmost support and cooperation. They have been a strong pillar to our students working hand in hand with the Tamil language teachers.<br>
