<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning in the Mother tongue is also crucial for improving other critical thinking skills, second language learning, and literacy skills. The Tamil language department in collaboration with the other MT departments @ GMS(P) instills the passion and use of the language to our students through various school-based programmes, activities and beyond. We believe our students will continue to love Tamil Language and render it as a “living language” in years to come.<br></p>

The Tamil Language framework<br>

<b>Key Programmes</b><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 1 - Transition from D.E.A.R Programme to TRP (Tamil Reading Programme) 
TRP is a transition from our Tamil department’s niche programme “D.E.A.R. - Drop Everything And Read” which was embarked in 2019 to enthuse  targeted students in their Oracy skills using Shared Book Approach. Students enjoyed the weekly sessions and developed their interest in reading. The Tamil department participated in MotherTongue Languages Symposium in 2019 with a booth setup and 2 students from the programme were the student ambassadors promoting the programme to fellow educators from other schools. <br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the success and positive feedback received, ‘D.E.A.R’ which was dearly conducted for only a targeted group has evolved into ‘TRP’ which now caters to all the Tamil students fortnightly. We believe storytelling brings language learning alive and creates a participatory and immersive experience that allows learners to enjoy hearing the language in a dynamic, sometimes stylistic and entertaining way. Hence, our Tamil department teachers record stories from our school library with expressions and voice modulations. These are played as presentations to our students.  Students are engaged to voice their opinions about the characters, the plot, new words and the conclusion. During these sessions, students also get to visit the library to borrow MT books. Our teachers have had interesting discussions with the students in Tamil language during these story-telling sessions. <br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 3 - MTL Reading Ambassadors (P1 to P6)
Reading has always been a niche area for the Mother Tongue Department. Hence this year, the MTL department has identified and nominated students who have a keen interest in reading and is able to promote that love of reading to his/her fellow peers. The Reading Ambassadors will also support their Tamil teachers during TRP sessions, manage the reading corners at Tamil class, promote suitable book titles and library visits. They had their 1st round of training on 17 March. So check in with your child if she/he is a Tamil Reading Ambassador.<br>


</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 2 - Buddy Reading Programme for P1 &amp; P2
The Buddy Reading Programme is a school based initiative to support our students who are identified for additional coaching beyond class time. Students feel safe and happy with their buddies. So why not get a buddy to read to the identified students? We have a few Tamil students from P2 who are in this programme and enjoy pairing up to read books in the morning during pre-assembly. The buddy is provided with a reading list and checklist so that he/she is better able to help her buddy with feedback.<br>


</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 2 - Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) for P3 &amp; P4
One of the recent initiatives from MOE to uplift students is the Mother Tongue Support Programme for our MT students. For Tamil language, students are expected to have mastered the learning of 247 Tamil letters at the end of Primary 2. Students will progress to deepen their reading and writing skills in Primary 3 and 4. MTSP is a targeted programme for identified students who require more reinforcement of their foundation years. Our Tamil teachers underwent special training to effectively conduct these classes for our selected students. MOE has also provided colourful, interesting instructional materials to better support the programme. At GMS(P) the Tamil MTSP is conducted weekly after curriculum time. <br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 3- Higher Mother Tongue Programme for P3 &amp; P4
Our Tamil department was one of the participating schools for the trial of the Higher Mother Tongue Curriculum. This programme has been rolled out to all schools this year. The aim of this programme is to further stretch students with good language proficiency in their respective Mother Tongue. Four of our current P5 Higher Mother Tongue students have been involved in the trial programme since 2020. Their keen interest for Tamil language is evident during their participation in class and written work. <br>


</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 1- Mother Tongue Fortnight Activities (P1-P6)
This year, MTL Fortnight celebrations started on 28 February and ended on -------- The 2 week programme was purposefully planned and conducted by our Tamil Language teachers. Adopting the WOW (Week of Wonder) process from NEL framework, our teachers planned ahead for the meaningful activities. We have developed the thematic approach for our students to gain cultural and historical knowledge of the topics. The activities planned also encouraged our students to converse in their Mother Tongue language frequently and more confidently with their peers as they engaged in group work. <br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of Primary 6, we hope to have provided them with memorable and joyful experiences of learning the Tamil language in an authentic platform with their peers. Our thematic topics are as follows-<br>
P1 - Healthy traditional breakfast (focus on thosai)<br>
P2 - Traditional flowers (focus on jasmine flowers)<br>
P3 - Traditional games (focus on paramapadham)<br>
P4-  Festivals (focus on Pongal festival)<br>
P5- Traditional costumes (focus on saree and dhoti)<br>
P6- Traditional puppetry (focus on creativity &amp; moral stories) <br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tier 1 - Celebrations of Festivals
Deepavali Celebrations 2021
Due to SMM measures, Deepavali celebrations took place on the online platform with videos, activities &amp; quizzes produced by the Tamil department teachers who collaborated with the other department teachers. Last year, the team decided to bring the whole school virtually to one of the teacher’s home to learn more about the culture and ways of mannerisms when visiting the Hindu home for celebrations. The medicinal benefits of eating in a banana leaf was explained to the visitor, the types of food placed on the banana leaf and even the way to folding the used banana leaf. The significance of drawing kolam and hanging of mango leaves was something new and interesting for the visitor. <br>

<b>Pongal Festival 2022</b><br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The harvest festival is celebrated over 3 days to give thanks to farmers, their cows and the sun. As an Asian country, the Tamil department teachers believe that our students should have awareness of the significance as rice is our staple food. We planned some interesting activities for our LP, MP and UP students. Videos from Indian Heritage centre were shown during lesson time and students had fun learning new things. At the end of the lesson, <br>
P1 &amp; P2 - coloured pictures <br>
P3 &amp; P4 - created greeting cards <br>
P5  - Crossword puzzle <br>
P6 - practised learning how to draw a rice kolam<br>
