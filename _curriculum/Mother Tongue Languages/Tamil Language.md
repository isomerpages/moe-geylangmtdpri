### Vision

Every Child an Active Learner and Proficient User of MTL

### Mission

### Overview

The Tamil Language curriculum aims to inculcate in all our students 3 broad objectives in the teaching and learning of MTL: 

1) **Communication** – to develop proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations.

2) **Culture** – to nurture our students to understand and have a deeper appreciation for their culture and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.

3) **Connection** – to enable our students to connect with communities across Asia who speak and share the language and culture.

### Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes

Besides the effective use of the curriculum materials, guidebooks and resources from AST (TL unit), Manavar Murasu, OPAL, MK small readers and Sutti Mayil magazine are additional support infused in the curriculum for teaching and learning at the TL classroom.

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies

In GMSP, Tamil students are actively engaged in learning Tamil language and culture in a meaningful setting. They are provided with various opportunities to engage in active learning of the language so that they will be confident and proficient users of their MT language in their daily conversations.  
  
The Singapore Teaching Practice serves as a guide for our teachers to plan and customize their lessons for their classes. Lessons are customized to arouse students’ interest and ignite the joy of learning Tamil Language. The key focus are as listed: 

1. Oracy precedes reading & writing <br>
2. Focus on applying the language in real-life situations <br>
3. Use proficiency descriptors to motivate learners to progress to the next stage of learning <br>
4. Greater use of ICT to engage learning & extends learning beyond the classroom
