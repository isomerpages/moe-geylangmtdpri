<p>Applying movement skills and game concepts during our PE lesson.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every GMS(P) student to be developed physically, cognitively and socially.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To equip students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to pursue and
enjoy a physically active and healthy living.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>We strive to develop our students into physically competent and confident
individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and
responsibly. Our students are engaged in physical and sporting activities
that build strong fundamental motor skills and game concepts.</p>
<p>Through our structured PE curriculum, we equip students with necessary
knowledge, skills and attitudes across 3 learning areas: <strong>Physical Activity, Outdoor Education and Physical Health and Safety </strong>(Figure
1). We believe that PE serves as an ideal platform for students to embody
our school motto, <em>"</em><strong><em>To Grow in Body, Friendship, and Mind</em></strong><em>,"</em> while
also developing 21st Century Competencies.

living habits through the following programmes:&nbsp;</p>
