<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every GMS(P) student to be developed physically, cognitively and socially.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To equip students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to pursue and
enjoy a physically active and healthy living.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>We strive to develop our students into physically competent and confident
individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and
responsibly. Our students are engaged in physical and sporting activities
that build strong fundamental motor skills and game concepts.</p>
<p>Through our structured PE curriculum, we equip students with necessary
knowledge, skills and attitudes across 3 learning areas: <strong>Physical Activity, Outdoor Education and Physical Health and Safety </strong>(Figure
1). We believe that PE serves as an ideal platform for students to embody
our school motto, <em>"</em><strong><em>To Grow in Body, Friendship, and Mind</em></strong><em>,"</em> while
also developing 21st Century Competencies.

<h4>Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies</h4>
<p>In striving towards holistic education, the PE Department has adopted
a framework for the learning of Physical &amp; Health Education based on
the schoolâ€™s:
<br>* Strategic Thrust 1: Nurturing the whole child
<br>* Strategic Thrust 4:&nbsp; Enhance Home-School-Community partnership
to support student learning and development
<br>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PHE%20Framework.jpg">
</div>
<p>Core of the Framework is based on the 2014 PE syllabus on developing students
to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle. GMS (P) applied the 3E approaches
of Equip, Enthuse and Expose modality in meeting the learning outcomes.
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition, the learning of PE is conducted with approaches such as Differentiated
Instructions, Making Thinking Visible practices and e-pedagogy approaches
in teaching. PE lessons are designed to meet different individual students
learning disposition and interests in order to ensure learning takes place
effectively.
<br>
</p>
<p>The department integrate the use of ICT to promote interest in meeting
the learning outcomes of PE i.e. the use of interactive app to provide
meaningful feedback for our students to adopt healthy and active lifestyle
in school and out of school.</p>
