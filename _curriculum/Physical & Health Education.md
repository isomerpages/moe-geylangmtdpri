<p style="text-align: justify;">Core of the Framework is based on the 2014 PE syllabus on developing students to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle. GMS (P) applied the 3E approaches of Equip, Enthuse and Expose modality in meeting the learning outcomes.<br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the learning of PE is conducted with approaches such as Differentiated Instructions, Making Thinking Visible practices and e-pedagogy approaches in teaching. PE lessons are designed to meet different individual students learning disposition and interests in order to ensure learning takes place effectively.<br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The department integrate the use of ICT to promote interest in meeting the learning outcomes of PE i.e. the use of interactive app to provide meaningful feedback for our students to adopt healthy and active lifestyle in school and out of school.</p>
