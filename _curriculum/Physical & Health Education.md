### Vision

### Mission

### Overview

In order to achieve the desired outcomes, we have adopted a 3-pronged approach: **Equip, Enthuse, Expose**

### Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes

Physical and Health Education in Geylang Methodist School (Primary) aims to develop our students into competent individuals who are able to learn physical skills and healthy habits to enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle. 

Students in GMS(P) are engaged in interesting physical and sporting activities that focus on fundamental motor skills and impressions leading towards specific movement patterns applicable to an array of skillset found in sports and games skills. The key learning areas found in MOE’s PE syllabus (Primary) are taught and learned by our student’s in their participation in PE. The physical activities are:  

* Dance
* Sports and Games
* Gymnastics 
* Physical Health & fitness
* Outdoor Education
* Athletics 
* Swimming
  
Through PE, students live up to the school’s motto of ‘To grow in body, friendship and mind’ and develop 21st century core competencies socio-emotional skills.  
  
Additionally, PE and health programmes in the school provide students with active, sporting opportunities and increase health awareness in the form of:

1.  Level Camp for P5
2.  Health Awareness Week
3.  Unstructured Play 
4.  Swimsafer Programme
5.  Inter-Class Games, and lots more ☺

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies

In striving towards holistic education, the PE Department has adopted a framework for the learning of Physical & Health Education based on the school’s:
* Strategic Thrust 1: Nurturing the whole child
* Strategic Thrust 4:  Enhance Home-School-Community partnership to support student learning and development

Core of the Framework is based on the 2014 PE syllabus on developing students to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle. GMS (P) applied the 3E approaches of Equip, Enthuse and Expose modality in meeting the learning outcomes.

In addition, the learning of PE is conducted with approaches such as Differentiated Instructions, Making Thinking Visible practices and e-pedagogy approaches in teaching. PE lessons are designed to meet different individual students learning disposition and interests in order to ensure learning takes place effectively.

The department integrate the use of ICT to promote interest in meeting the learning outcomes of PE i.e. the use of interactive app to provide meaningful feedback for our students to adopt healthy and active lifestyle in school and out of school.
