### Vision

Raising readers and building a strong foundation in the English Language

### Mission

Readers now, Effective Users of the English Language for life

### Overview

Our curriculum goals are for every GMS(P) student to be a reader and acquire a strong foundation in the English Language. This enables them to understand and be understood by fellow users of the language.

### Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes

To achieve our curricular goals, the school’s EL curriculum is developed from MOE’s English Syllabus 2020 and closely aligned to the STELLAR (Strategies for English Langauge Learning and Reading) programme. On top of that, the school-based curriculum caters to the learning needs of our student profile.

School-based curriculum

The school-based curriculum allows the teachers to meet the learning needs of the pupils of the level by providing explicit teaching and targeted practice in those areas.

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies

 **STELLAR - Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading**  

STELLAR is a language teaching programme that is designed to help our Lower Primary pupils acquire English Language skills through activities in speaking, listening, reading and writing. 

One of the main focus of STELLAR is the use of the Shared Book Approach (SBA), an integrated and balanced language teaching approach that uses motivating and enjoyable “big books” of enlarged print and illustrations. STELLAR is part of SEED although its primary focus is on reading and language acquisition.

The Modified Language Experience (MLEA) is incorporated into STELLAR where pupils begin their writing experiences in small groups of mixed abilities. There are also learning centres where small groups of children at similar levels of progress can gather for the reinforcement and extension of SBA and MLEA. 

The school provides strong support for STELLAR in terms of training and teaching resources. It is the greatest desire of the teachers to guide our pupils through STELLAR so that they will be able to communicate effectively in English both in oral and written forms.
