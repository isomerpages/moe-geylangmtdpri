<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;At GMS(P), we are committed to nurturing every student to be an <strong>informed</strong>,
competent, confident and empathetic communicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Our English curriculum is anchored on four key pillars:</p>
<p><em><u>Developing Avid and Informed Readers</u></em>
</p>
<p>We cultivate students who read widely and think deeply about texts. They
learn to evaluate sources critically, distinguish facts from opinion, and
recognise misinformation and bias. In doing so, they grow into curious,
discerning and imaginative readers who see themselves as active meaning-makers
of their world.</p>
<p><em><u>Nurturing Confident and Empathetic Communicators</u></em>
<br>We develop informed students who embody the GMS(P) INSPIRE values, dispositions
and skills to listen actively to diverse perspectives and communicate effectively
with purpose, audience and context in mind.</p>
<p><em><u>Cultivating Curious and Connected Learners<br></u></em>We cultivate
curious learners who ask thoughtful questions and make meaningful connections
between classroom learning and the real world. Through authentic experiences,
they explore diverse perspectives, apply language with purpose, and recognise
the relevance of English beyond the classroom.</p>
<p><em><u>Developing Empowered and Self-Directed Learners</u></em>
</p>
<p>We develop reflective and self-directed learners who take ownership of
their growth. Through intentional teacher, self and peer feedback, students
monitor their progress, act on next steps, and grow in confidence as independent
learners.</p>
<p><strong>------</strong>
<br>These pillars come alive through our key programmes and initiatives across
all levels, ensuring purposeful platforms for every student to be stretched,
supported and empowered to grow.</p>
