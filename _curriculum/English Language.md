### Vision
To enrich students’ learning experiences by taking them out of the classroom to experience how language is used in real-life contexts and bring the world into the classroom through the use of multimodal texts.

### Mission
Readers now, Effective Users of the English Language for life


### Curriculum Structure and Key Programmes
Taking reference from the MOE English Language  Syllabus 2020 and aligning to the STELLAR 2.0 (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading), the school’s EL curriculum is designed for real-life application and the teaching of values and social-emotional competencies. Recognising that every student has a different learning profile, there is explicit teaching in the following areas at different levels.
     
| Level | Area of Focus |
|---|---|
| P3 & P4 | Writing |
| P5 & P6 | Writing<br>Comprehension<br>Synthesis & Transformation |

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies

 **STELLAR - Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading**  

STELLAR is a language teaching programme that is designed to help our Lower Primary pupils acquire English Language skills through activities in speaking, listening, reading and writing. 

One of the main focus of STELLAR is the use of the Shared Book Approach (SBA), an integrated and balanced language teaching approach that uses motivating and enjoyable “big books” of enlarged print and illustrations. STELLAR is part of SEED although its primary focus is on reading and language acquisition.

The Modified Language Experience (MLEA) is incorporated into STELLAR where pupils begin their writing experiences in small groups of mixed abilities. There are also learning centres where small groups of children at similar levels of progress can gather for the reinforcement and extension of SBA and MLEA. 

The school provides strong support for STELLAR in terms of training and teaching resources. It is the greatest desire of the teachers to guide our pupils through STELLAR so that they will be able to communicate effectively in English both in oral and written forms.
