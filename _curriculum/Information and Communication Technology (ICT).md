### Curriculum and Key Programmes
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nurturing the whole child
ICT is used as an enabler for enhanced learning which all departments utilize to achieve a holistic education for the students. We hope to provide opportunities for our students to be joyful and responsible digital learners through a range of quality learning experiences with technology. Students will be given more opportunities to hone their abilities in being self-directed and independent, and in the process, develop stronger passion and intrinsic motivation in learning.

<p style="text-align: justify;">ICT is infused into the curriculum to make learning more effective, engaging and interesting for our students. Lessons in Cyber Hubs, outdoor learning, learning journeys all utilizes ICT hardware and software to enhance students’ learning experiences.
 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Encourage experimentation and innovation through opportunities and stretched programmes
For students who wish to further enhance their ICT skills, Info-comm Technology Club is a platform which offers game design, drone programming, Microbits, Movie-making, and app development.

**Cyber Wellness**
<p style="text-align: justify;">While encouraging our students to make use of technology, we recognize the importance of educating our students to be discerning and responsible digital citizens. The inculcation of Cyber Wellness concepts in students, enable students to recognize potential hazards that can take place in the Cyber World and teaches them the skills to protect themselves.

### Pedagogical Approaches / Strategies
<p style="text-align: justify;">21st century learners are active and life-long learners. They need skills and competencies pertaining to group-based problem solving and knowledge creation. Self-Directed Learning (SDL) and Collaborative Learning (CoL) are part of the development of the 21CC, as they are learning processes through which our Desired Outcomes of Education can be achieved.  The Outcome Goal is that students develop competencies for self-directed and collaborative learning through the effective use of ICT, as well as become discerning and responsible ICT users, so that they can learn and work effectively in the 21st century knowledge-based environment.

**Use of ICT to promote Student Engagement**
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every Department will use the ICT e-Pedagogical approach to promote Student Engagement in their subject. We hope to leverage digital technology to deepen students' learning.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Student Learning Space (SLS) is one example that learning with technology in GMS(P) is guided by the SLS Pedagogical Scaffold which enables teachers to design technology-enabled learning experiences to enhance students’ learning.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the student iCON is a suite of Google apps including email, other app services such as Google Classroom and Google Drive that helps to better support the student’s learning and collaboration with others. These useful applications will be provided progressively and will follow the students through their learning journey from Primary school to Secondary school.
