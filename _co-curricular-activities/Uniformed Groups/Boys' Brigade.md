<h4>CCA Overview</h4>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade (BB) is a CCA that focuses on the development of the
youth. Its mission is to nurture youth, based on sound values, to lead
and serve. We believe in training up a child to be disciplined and to be
God fearing. Our motto is Sure and Steadfast and it is taken from Hebrews
6:19 of the bible (KJV).</p>
<p>The BB’s innovative and customised integrated four-year programme consists
of activities and events, with the aim of building confidence for leadership
and service, as well as to nurture compassion and enable character development.</p>
<p>Some of the key BB programmes organised for our boys this year were our
camp that was full of fun activities and team bonding sessions. There are
many activities to explore such as rock climbing, archery, laser tag and
outdoor cooking!</p>
<p>During weekly parades and training, our Boys are exposed to a variety
of courses and activities, such as foot drills. and life skill courses
such as first aid, map reading and navigation. In BB, character development
is crucial. BB events such as the BB National Share-A-Gift programme, BB
Cares project help them develop compassion for the less fortunate as well
as show appreciation for the people around them.</p>
<p>The boys are also given the opportunities to strive for excellence by
representing the school in various national competitions such as the BB
Adventure Quest and BB Character Quest in which teamwork and perseverance
are also emphasised.</p>
<p>With a team of committed teachers, officers and our Boys, our company
has consistently excelled in the past decade with its strong track record
in the annual JM Fraser Award for Unit Excellence, the highest accolade
for BB Companies in Singapore awarded by BB Headquarters (BBHQ).In 2023,
Joel Soh Yong En from 6-8 was awarded the Best Boy Award, which is the
highest accolade for BB Boys in Singapore awarded by BBHQ every year.
