### CCA Overview 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Boys’ Brigade (BB) is a CCA that focuses on the development of the youth. Its mission is to nurture youth, based on sound values, to lead and serve. We believe in training up a child to be disciplined and to be God fearing. Our motto is Sure and Steadfast an it is taken from Hebrews 6:19 of the bible (KJV).

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a team of committed teachers, officers and boy leaders, the BB has consistently excelled in the past decade with its strong track record in the annual JM Fraser Award for Unit Excellence, the highest accolade for BB Companies in Singapore awarded by BB Headquarters (BBHQ).

<p style="text-align: justify;">The BB’s innovative and customised integrated four-year programme consists of activities and events either organised by company or by BBHQ, with the aim of building confidence for leadership and service, as well as to nurture compassion and enable character development.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the key BB programmes organised for our boys this year were our camps are full of fun activities and team bonding sessions. There are many activities to explore such as rock climbing, archery, laser tag and outdoor cooking!

<p style="text-align: justify;">During weekly parades and training, our Boys are exposed to a variety of courses and activities, such as foot drills. and life skill courses such as first aid, map reading and navigation. In BB, character development is crucial. BB events such as the BB National Share-A-Gift programme, BB Cares project help them develop compassion for the less fortunate as well as show appreciation for the people around them.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The boys are also given the opportunities to strive for excellence by representing the school in various national competitions such as the BB Adventure Quest and BB Character Quest in which teamwork is also emphasised. The 21J BB teams have consistently achieved Honour Roll awards in these national competitions.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, He Meng Xiu from 6-6 has been awarded the Best Boy Award, which is the highest accolades for BB Boys in Singapore awarded by BBHQ every year.
