<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Football CCA in GMS(P) believes in giving our boys as much exposure as
possible to nurture their interest in the sport, and through it, build
up the character of our players. We place a big emphasis on teamwork and
encouraging one another no matter what challenges we face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Every Monday afternoon, our coaches and football teachers guide
and nurture our GMS(P) footballers in technical skills, gameplay tactics,
as well as competition mentality. It is important to us that our students
learn to find the right balance of playing to win while maintaining the
spirit of sportsmanship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our GMS(P) school team players proudly represent our school in the
National School Games, as well as friendly matches and invitationals. Other
Football CCA students also get to experience the element of competition
in the form of our very own internal football league. We are also constantly
on the lookout for external opportunities for our players such as the FIFA
Football For Schools clinic.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Highlight:</strong></h4>
<p>On 28<sup>th</sup> October 2024, Football CCA boys had the privilege of
experiencing an exciting tour of Singapore Premier League Club, Lion City
Sailor’s, football academy. This learning journey was organized by our
Football CCA teachers to give our football boys a taste of life as a professional
footballer. Our boys had the opportunity to not only view the impressive
facilities at the academy but also try out some of the high-tech fitness
and strength conditioning equipment. The professional coaches and staff
at the club conducted a session where they shared the importance of proper
diet, nutrition, and recovery in a professional footballer’s life. It was
an eye-opening experience which inspired our budding footballers to work
hard to pursue their footballing dreams.</p>
