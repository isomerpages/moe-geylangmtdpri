### CCA Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">Football CCA in GMSP believes in giving all our boys as much exposure as possible to nurture their interest in the sport, and through it, build up the character of all our players. We place a big emphasis on teamwork and encouraging one another no matter what challenges we face.&nbsp;

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Starting 2023, Football CCA in GMS(P) will embark on the Schools Football Academy (SFA) programme in collaboration with the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) as part of the nation’s Unleash The Roar (UTR) project aimed at improving football at all levels in Singapore. 

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As part of this collaboration, GMS(P) students participating in football, will receive coaching from professionally-certified coaches on a weekly basis. These coaches will not only be conducting training sessions in the field, but also mentor our boys in areas of nutrition, proper rest and recovery, as well as values and character development.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GMS(P) school team players also have the opportunity to participate in the National School Games, as well as friendly matches and invitationals. Our other Football CCA students also get to experience the element of competition in the form of our very own internal Eagles Premier League. <br>

<b>Highlight:</b><br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the 4th of March 2023, thirty of our football boys were invited to be a part of the FIFA “Football For Schools” festival at the Jalan Besar Stadium. This festival was held to commemorate the launch of the FIFA Football For Schools app in Singapore and our boys had the opportunity to experience first-hand the professionally-crafted training sessions found in the app. It was an exciting day of football learning and fun for all involved and we look forward to more such opportunities for our students.</p>
