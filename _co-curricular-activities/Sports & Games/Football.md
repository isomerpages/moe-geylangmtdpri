<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>

<p>Every Monday afternoon, our coaches and football teachers guide and nurture
our GMS(P) footballers in technical skills, gameplay tactics, as well as
competition mentality. It is important to us that our students learn to
find the right balance of playing to win while maintaining the spirit of
sportsmanship.</p>

<p>Our GMS(P) school team players proudly represent our school in the National
School Games, as well as friendly matches and invitationals. Other Football
CCA students also get to experience the element of competition in the form
of our very own internal football league. We are also constantly on the
lookout for external opportunities for our players such as the FIFA Football
For Schools clinic.</p>

<h4><strong>Highlight:</strong></h4>
<p>On 28<sup>th</sup> October 2024, Football CCA boys had the privilege of
experiencing an exciting tour of Singapore Premier League Club, Lion City
Sailor’s, football academy. This learning journey was organized by our
Football CCA teachers to give our football boys a taste of life as a professional
footballer. Our boys had the opportunity to not only view the impressive
facilities at the academy but also try out some of the high-tech fitness
and strength conditioning equipment. The professional coaches and staff
at the club conducted a session where they shared the importance of proper
diet, nutrition, and recovery in a professional footballer’s life. It was
an eye-opening experience which inspired our budding footballers to work
hard to pursue their footballing dreams.</p>
