### CCA Overview

Football CCA in GMSP believes in giving all our boys as much exposure as possible to nurture their interest in the sport, and through it, build up the character of all our players. We place a big emphasis on teamwork and encouraging one another no matter what challenges we face. 

There are ample opportunities for our boys to develop their talents through the various external competitions we participate in, our collaborations with Singapore Premier League clubs, and even our own Eagles Premier League competition.
