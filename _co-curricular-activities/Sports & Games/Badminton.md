### CCA Overview  

<p style="text-align: justify;">To be part of Badminton CCA in GMS(P) is to be part of a family that foregrounds the importance of values such as perseverance, teamwork and respect in sports. We seek to cultivate good character and ignite passion in the sport of badminton. 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of ability level, every member is given the opportunity to harness his or her potential through training and practice. We aim to equip students to play with confidence and aptitude and provide them with opportunities to do so through friendly and competitive platforms, within the school, or at zonal and national levels.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe every badminton player is special and will grow in ‘friendship, body and mind’ to reach his or her fullest potential.
