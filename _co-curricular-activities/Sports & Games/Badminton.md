### CCA Overview  

The Badminton CCA in GMSP is based upon the school motto ‘to grow in friendship body and mind’. We aim to instill interest and passion in the sports of badminton and to coach and develop every child to their fullest potential.

Our badminton CCA compromises of the recreational team and the school team. Our recreational team is made up of students who are passionate about the game and those who perform well will be selected for the school team to represent the school in the National School Games.

Through the various competition, we encourage the pupils to demonstrate the values of sportsmanship and teamwork. We believe in the importance of values over results and focus more on the teaching of values during our CCA sessions.
