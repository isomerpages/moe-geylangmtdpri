Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is integral to the holistic development of students in GMS(P), seeking to nurture interests, develop talent and cultivate a zest for life. They also provide a natural platform for the development of character and strengthening of friendship.  

Our school offers 17 CCAs in the domains of Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies as well as Uniformed Groups. CCA are conducted on Mondays, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Some CCA may require additional practices during competition periods.  
  
All P4 to P6 students are required to participate in one CCA. Students are only allowed to change their CCA in the following year, subject to availability of places. All P3 students will experience modular CCA approach on a rotational basis on Monday afternoon in Term 3.
