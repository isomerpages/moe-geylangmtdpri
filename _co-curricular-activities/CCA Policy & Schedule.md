<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is integral to the holistic development of students in GMS(P), seeking to nurture interests, develop talent and cultivate a zest for life. They also provide a natural platform for the development of character&nbsp;and strengthening&nbsp;of friendship.  

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our school offers 17 CCAs in the domains of Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies as well as&nbsp;Uniformed&nbsp;Groups.&nbsp;CCAs are conducted on Mondays, 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.&nbsp;Some CCAs may require additional&nbsp;practices&nbsp;during competition&nbsp;periods.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">All P4 to P6 students are required to participate in one CCA.  All P3 students will experience modular CCA approach on a rotational basis.</p>
