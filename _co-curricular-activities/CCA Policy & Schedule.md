<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are integral to the holistic development
of students at GMS(P). They provide opportunities for students to nurture
their interests, develop talents, and cultivate a zest for life, while
also serving as a natural platform for character development and the strengthening
of friendships.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Our school offers 17 CCAs across the domains of Sports, Visual and Performing
Arts, Clubs and Societies, and Uniformed Groups. CCAs are conducted on
Tuesdays from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. Some CCAs may require additional training
sessions during competition periods.
<br>
<br>All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are required to participate in one
CCA.&nbsp;
