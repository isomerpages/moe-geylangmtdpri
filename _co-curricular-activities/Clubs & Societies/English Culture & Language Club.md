<h4 style="color:blue;">CCA Overview</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">GMS(P) English Culture and Language Club offers Drama CCA students a platform to:<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">• learn valuable stage craft skills (in acting, movement, voice) with the aim of making
performances.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">• explore the art form of theatre-making thereby building a love and appreciation for Drama.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">• exemplify values such as teamwork, perseverance and confidence in everything they do.<br>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">• explore the process of Drama – from stories, to scripts, to putting it onto the floor, to rehearsing and finally, to performing.<br>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Opportunities will be given for students to hone their skills and demonstrate their capabilities in peer-to-peer showcases. This allow students to become confident performers and makers of the art, in both mini presentations as well as in school performances and competitions.<br></p>
