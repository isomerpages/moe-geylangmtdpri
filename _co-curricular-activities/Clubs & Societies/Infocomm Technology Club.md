### CCA Overview    

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Infocomm Media Club aims to excite students about Information and Communications Technology (ICT) through the use of digital media and mobile technologies as well as game design and app development. 

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Club seeks to cultivate leadership skills by equipping students as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. They get to present their digital artefacts to their peers. They also have opportunities to participate in infocomm media competitions.  

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Through the myriad learning opportunities in Infocomm Media Club, we hope our members will be better able to navigate the digital landscape in the future while growing in friendship, body and mind.
