### CCA Overview    

The Info-comm Technology Club CCA in GMSP aims to excite students about Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in a fun and meaningful way by helping them to learn skills such as use of digital media, mobile technologies as well as software and games development.  

Through the club’s activities, students will better appreciate technology and learn about application development, programming and Cyber Wellness.  

The club aims to cultivate leadership skills by equipping students with the skills to be peer advocates of Cyber Wellness. They will present their digital artefacts during the school’s Cyber Wellness Week.

Students will be able to apply what they have learned by taking part in a variety of Infocomm related competitions such as Microbits and photography competitions. They also have opportunities to be the photographer for school events.

Through the myriad learning opportunities in Info-comm Technology Club, we hope our members will be able to better navigate the digital landscape in the future while at the same time growing in friendship, body and mind.
