### CCA Overview

The Art Club provides a platform for pupils to expose, explore and express themselves through Art. The Art program serves to capture pupils with varied interest and caters to differentiated needs beyond the curriculum syllabus. Pupils are given opportunities to showcase their talent and expand their knowledge in art and art-making through different media and forms such as drawing, mixed media relief, clay modeling and painting. Through the program, we hope to nurture our pupils and develop within them qualities such as perseverance, excellence and integrity which will enable them to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.
