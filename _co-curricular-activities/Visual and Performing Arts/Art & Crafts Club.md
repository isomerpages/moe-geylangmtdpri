### CCA Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">Art Club offers pupils with interest in visual arts to come together and learn about art making. Pupils are given the opportunity to explore art forms beyond what is offered in the school curriculum. Our programme promotes imagination, creativity, and self-expression. Art Club creates a platform for pupils to showcase their talents and expand their knowledge. Pupils can explore and experiment with various art materials individually and in groups. Through learning different art forms such as drawing, painting, mixed-media and 3D art, pupils develop valuable skills and character traits such as resilience, perseverance, and responsibility. They also learn how to be a good team player, as well as show kindness and respect for one another.<br>
