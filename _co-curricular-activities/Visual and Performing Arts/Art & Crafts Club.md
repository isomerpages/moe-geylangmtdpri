<h4><br><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Art Club offers pupils with interest in visual arts to come together and
learn about art making. Pupils are given the opportunity to explore art
forms beyond what is offered in the school curriculum. Our programme promotes
imagination, creativity, and self-expression. Art Club creates a platform
for pupils to showcase their talents and expand their knowledge. Pupils
can explore and experiment with various art materials individually and
in groups. Through learning different art forms such as drawing, painting,
mixed-media and 3D art, pupils develop valuable skills and character traits
such as resilience, perseverance, and responsibility. They also learn how
to be a good team player, as well as show kindness and respect for one
another.
