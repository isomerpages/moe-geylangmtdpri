<h4>CCA Overview</h4>
<p>In Modern Dance, we believe that with the right attitude and determination,
EVERYONE CAN DANCE! Through this CCA, we hope that students will be able
to express themselves using their talents, showing who they can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern Dance at GMS(P) comprises of students both with and without dance
backgrounds. Dance holds a special place in these children’s hearts and
often fills it with joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our dancers work towards a common goal of attaining excellence with joy.
New friendships are forged in the process, as we strive to overcome various
challenges as a team. Modern Dance is more than just an aesthetic art form.
A strong set of values is instilled in very one of our dancers as they
embark on their journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this CCA, the dancers also get the opportunity to view external performances
and be exposed to a wide array of dance genres as well as techniques.</p>
<p>We have yearly performances in school for key events like Chinese New
Year, Founders’ Day, Teachers’ Day and Year-End Prize Giving Day.</p>
