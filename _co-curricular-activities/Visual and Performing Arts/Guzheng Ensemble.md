<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The guzheng, a traditional Chinese string instrument, captivates with
its beautiful, resonant tones and rich cultural history.</p>
<p>Being part of a guzheng ensemble allows children to immerse themselves
in the fascinating world of Chinese music, fostering an appreciation for
its cultural heritage. Ensemble participation not only helps in mastering
the guzheng's playing techniques but also promotes important life skills
such as teamwork, concentration, and discipline.</p>
<p>As children practice and perform alongside their peers, they develop strong
bonds, share the joy of creating harmonious music, and build confidence
through performances.</p>
<p>The guzheng ensemble welcomes children of all skill levels, from beginners
to advanced players, and anyone with a passion for music and a desire to
learn something new. Children will learn guzheng playing techniques, ensemble
coordination and harmony, and musical expression and performance skills</p>
