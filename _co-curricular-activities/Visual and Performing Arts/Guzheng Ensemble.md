<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The guzheng, a traditional Chinese string instrument, captivates with
its beautiful, resonant tones and rich cultural history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being part of a guzheng ensemble allows children to immerse themselves
in the fascinating world of Chinese music, fostering an appreciation for
its cultural heritage. Ensemble participation not only helps in mastering
the guzheng's playing techniques but also promotes important life skills
such as teamwork, concentration, and discipline. As children practice and
perform alongside their peers, they develop strong bonds, share the joy
of creating harmonious music, and build confidence through performances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, our school’s guzheng ensemble has had an incredible year filled
with remarkable achievements and memorable experiences. In April, our group
of young musicians participated in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Showcase and was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, our ensemble had the honor of performing at our school’s
100th Anniversary Concert. As we look forward to more opportunities and
challenges, we are immensely proud of our guzheng ensemble's accomplishments
and their continued dedication to excellence in music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guzheng ensemble welcomes children of all skill levels, from beginners
to advanced players, and anyone with a passion for music and a desire to
learn something new. Children will learn guzheng playing techniques, ensemble
coordination and harmony, and musical expression and performance skills.</p>
