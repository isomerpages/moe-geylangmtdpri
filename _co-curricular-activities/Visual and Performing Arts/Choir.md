<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The GMS(P) choir nurtures students' vocal talents and choral awareness,
offering a platform for those with beautiful voices to shine. Under the
guidance of our conductor, Joyce Lee Tung, students train in warm-ups,
part-singing, ear-training, and a wide range of song genres. They also
learn basic music theory related to the songs they perform.</p>

<p>Students gain regular opportunities to perform at school and choir events,
building confidence and stage presence. By singing together and supporting
one another, students not only grow as vocalists but also build lasting
friendships and a strong sense of community.</p>

<p>Kudos to our school choir! On Friday, 25 July 2025, they participated
in the Singapore International Choral Festival (SICF), where the artistic
panel was made up of experts not only from Singapore but from all around
the world.</p>
<p>The festival is a vibrant celebration of music, bringing together people
in the heart of Singapore to share their passion for singing, learn from
each other, and create lasting memories that will echo long after the final
performance.</p>
<p>Our choir took part in a workshop and then joined other participating
groups for the competition. We are thrilled to announce that our choir
earned a score of 74.7% and achieved a Silver award!</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated choir teachers, Mrs. Serene Goh,
Ms. Tan Cher Hui, and Ms. Jeanne Leo, for their unwavering support and
commitment to the choir. Their dedication has provided such a valuable
platform for the students to grow and pursue their musical passions.</p>
