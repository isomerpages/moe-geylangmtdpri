<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The GMS(P) choir nurtures students' vocal talents and choral awareness,
offering a platform for those with beautiful voices to shine. Under the
guidance of our conductor, Joyce Lee Tung, students train in warm-ups,
part-singing, ear-training, and a wide range of song genres. They also
learn basic music theory related to the songs they perform.</p>

<p>Students gain regular opportunities to perform at school and choir events,
building confidence and stage presence. By singing together and supporting
one another, students not only grow as vocalists but also build lasting
friendships and a strong sense of community.</p>
