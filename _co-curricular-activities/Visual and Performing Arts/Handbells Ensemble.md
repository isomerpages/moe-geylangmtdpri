### CCA Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">A handbell ensemble is a group that rings recognizable music with melodies and harmony. Our ringers are focussed and disciplined during practice, and they ensure that they attend practices because it takes teamwork to ring a piece of music well.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our accomplished ringers are able to produce beautiful pieces of music because of their passion, drive and discipline. We are looking forward to Singapore Youth Festival 2024! </p>
