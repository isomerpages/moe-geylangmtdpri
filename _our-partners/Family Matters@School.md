<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to praise God for giving us the opportunity to start the Family Matters@School(FMS) in the school. FMS was launched on 2 April, 2010 and its centre is in operation in the current AGAPE room which is now known as the SFE Centre.  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">FMS is one of the recommendations of Family Matters Singapore(FMS), previously known as Public Education Committee on Family (PEC).  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">FMS adopts a holistic family learning model – equipping parents with effective parenting skills and training them to be parent facilitators, helping the staff of the school to enhance their family life, and providing students with life skills training.  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The parent-child relationship has much impact on the child’s academic achievements and positive attitudes / behaviour, regardless of socio-economic status, ethnic / racial background or parents’ education level.  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">With support from North West, South East and South West CDCs, and Fei Yue Counselling Centre, FMS was piloted in Nanyang and Temasek Primary Schools, and Bartley and Commonwealth Secondary Schools in January 2002. FMS was launched by Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, then Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports on 15 April 2002.  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">FMS has been well received by parents and participating schools. Since 2002, it has reached close to 2 million people. As at 2010, there are 227 schools in the FMS programme.  
  

### Objectives

<p style="text-align: justify;">The FMS aims to help bond families and individuals (namely, parents, students and staff) through programmes and activities approved by MCYS.  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The FMS hopes to enhance the quality of family life and indirectly also impact the positive growth of the children in the school. Therefore, we hope to have your full support and participation on the SFE programmes and activities.

  
### Features

<p style="text-align: justify;">1.&nbsp;<b>Family Learning</b><br> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">A family that learns together grows together. Therefore, FMS Programmes are designed and planned to promote better parent-child understanding through talks, workshops and activities.  
      
    
2.&nbsp;<b>Training Parents to be Facilitators</b><br>  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under FMS, parents volunteers are trained to become parent facilitators. They will provide guidance to other parents and help to facilitate workshops and support groups that aim to impart positive parenting skills.  
      
    
3.&nbsp;<b>School Staff’s Family Wellness</b>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school staff are also members of families. FMS will provide them with programme to help them better manage their work and family life. Enhanced family life will translate into higher productivity for the school.
