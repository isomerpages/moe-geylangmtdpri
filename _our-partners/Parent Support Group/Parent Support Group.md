### Chairman's Message

<p style="text-align: justify;">    The GMS(P) Parent Support Group (PSG) has come a long way since its humble beginnings, we believe at the heart of every successful and fulfilling parenting journey lies the support of a strong community and communication is crucial between all key stakeholders within the GMS(P) family between School Leadership Team &amp; Staffs, PSG, Parent Volunteers (PVs) and Students.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of our PSG is to create a safe and inclusive space where parents can connect, share their stories and support one another, go beyond supporting your own child and also contributing to a larger learning community within the school. Parent Volunteers could build rapport with Teachers and join the PSG Team through numerous School or PSG organized activities; these activities would not have been possible if not for the enduring support from the many dedicated Parent Volunteers.&nbsp; A very big thank you to all who have given your time and personal contribution.&nbsp; The school and students have benefited from all our involvement.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The PSG Team endeavors to continue our partnership with the school to provide a holistic education and personal development for the students. It is the PSG's belief that in being supportive partners of the school, this will enable us to nurture our GMS(P) students to be contributors in the community. Together we tap on each otherâ€™s strengths to make GMS(P) a more vibrant environment for the students.&nbsp; We trust that you will find joining the PSG an enriching and worthwhile experience. So why wait, come join us today.
