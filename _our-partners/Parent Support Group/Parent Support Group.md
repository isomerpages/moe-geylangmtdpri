### Chairman's Message

<p style="text-align: justify;">Communication is a crucial bridge between all people and communication between&nbsp;parents and children is one of the most important aspects here, since the way parents&nbsp;communicate with their children teaches and affects how they will communicate in the&nbsp;future.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Talking to our children regularly makes us aware of what they are experiencing in school&nbsp;and their lives. Just by asking about their homework or spelling is simply not enough. An open-minded question that makes it possible for the child to share his or her joy, glory,&nbsp;uncertainties and anxieties would certainly create the opportunity for us to encourage,&nbsp;assure and show our interest in their lives.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By joining the Parent Support Group (PSG), we assure you will go beyond supporting your own&nbsp;child and contributing to a larger group of students in the school. Parent volunteers also&nbsp;have the opportunity to build rapport with teachers and the Principal. Our group of parents&nbsp;who are loving supporters serve weekly as individual tutors in the English reading&nbsp;programs and act as chaperons to help out in the school library or the SwimSafer course.&nbsp;On top of these, we also support many other school events such as the Primary 1 Orientation,&nbsp;first day of school, Learning Week and Sports Carnival.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the PSG's belief that in being supportive partners of the school, this will enable us to&nbsp;nurture our GMSP learners to be&nbsp;contributors in the community. By this, we look forward&nbsp;to more parents coming on board this partnership adventure to discover your strengths&nbsp;and help us grow GMSP from strength to strength.

So, come join us!
