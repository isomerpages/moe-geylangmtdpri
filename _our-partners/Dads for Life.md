### About Us

<p style="text-align: justify;">CDads for Life (DFL) is a national fathers movement that seeks to inspire, mobilise and involve fathers to become good influencers in their children's lives... for life!  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The movement is strongly anchored in research that highlights the distinct benefits of paternal involvement on child development in terms of improved cognitive, socio-emotional, psychological and academic outcomes. Active paternal involvement is also linked to better couple relationships among parents, lower levels of maternal stress, and positive changes in fathers' self-identity, all of which suggest overall benefits for the family.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DFL at GMS(P) was launched in 2011 and has been organising activities to facilitate a 3-pronged approach A.C.T. in mobilising fathers of GMS(P) students to ACT:  <br>
	* Be&nbsp;<b>A</b>ware of the importance of their roles as husbands and fathers.<br>
	* <b>C</b>ommit to become good fathers and role models to their children.<br>
	* Spend&nbsp;<b>T</b>ime to acquire Tools and bring Transformation to lives.
      
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A group of fathers from the school got together to form a small committee to plan and organise activities for the movement in the school. We are partially funded by the MCYS and enthusiastically supported by the Principal and Vice-Principal.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past events ranged from awareness parenting talks to group get-together (eg. weekly badminton sessions) to watching a themed movie to an overnight outing to the Underwater World. Those who attended rated these events very highly because they become more committed after each event.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As more fathers realise they do make a difference in their children’s lives, they are conscious of their roles and they begin to commit to spending more time with their children. The end objective is transformed relationships, and thus transformed lives.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some children at GMS(P) are less privileged; they don’t have fathers to begin with. It is our hope at DFL that at some point, some of these fathers can step up and offer themselves as role models for these children and inspire them too. This still seeks to transform lives.  
  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you have ideas, time or energy (or all three!) to contribute, please do! Just contact the school.  <br>
