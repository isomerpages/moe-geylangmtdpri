<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>Launched in 2009, DADs for Life (DFL) is Singapore’s National Fathers
Movement that seeks to inspire, mobilise and involve fathers to become
good influences in their children’s lives – for life! The DADs for Life
movement is an initiative of Centre for Fathering, a non-profit organisation
established in 2000 that empowers more fathers to be better role models
and an enduring inspiration to their children.</p>
<p>DFL@GMSP was launched in 2011 and had been organising activities to mobilise
and inspire fathers of GMSP students to <strong>ACT</strong>:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be <strong>AWARE</strong> of the importance
of a father’s role</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>COMMIT</strong> to be good
fathers and role models to their children</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spend <strong>TIME</strong>, acquire
TOOLS and bring TRANSFORMATION to lives</p>
<p>A group of fathers from the school formed a small committee to plan and
organise activities for the movement in the school. We are partially funded
by the school and Christalite Methodist Chapel, and enthusiastically supported
by the School Leaders.</p>
<p>Examples of past events include hiking activities, kite-flying, parenting
talks, laser tag games, overnight camping at Pulau Ubin and many others.
Those who attended rated these events well and became more committed fathers
after each event.</p>
