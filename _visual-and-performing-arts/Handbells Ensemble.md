### CCA Overview

A handbell ensemble is a group that rings recognizable music with melodies and harmony. Our ringers are focussed and disciplined during practice, and they ensure that they attend practices because it takes teamwork to ring a piece of music well.

Our accomplished ringers are able to produce beautiful pieces of music because of their passion, drive and discipline.
